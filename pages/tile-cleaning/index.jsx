              Tile and stone in areas such as the like kitchens, foyers, and family rooms are definitely heavily trafficked space where dirt and grime accumulate over time and requires maintenance, just like your carpets. If left untreated, grout stains and buildup will create an area for bacteria to develop and create unsightly discoloration.

              After cleaning, we recommend having your clean tile sealed. Hard surfaces that are unsealed are much like a sponge and will absorb oil, food, or beverage spills, resulting in permanent staining. Proper sealing can protect your flooring from permanent damage by creating an invisible barrier over the tile and grout.
