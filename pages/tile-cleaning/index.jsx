                Tile and stone in areas such as the like kitchens, foyers, and family rooms are definitely heavily trafficked space where dirt and grime accumulate over time and requires maintenance, just like your carpets. If left untreated, grout stains and buildup will create an area for bacteria to develop and create unsightly discoloration.

                Cleaning bathroom grout is not as easy as taking a mop to it. If you want a real level of cleanliness, you need to have Woodcreek Carpet Tech floor tiles to deep clean into your grout and remove all traces of dirt and bacteria.

                After cleaning, we recommend having your clean tile sealed. Hard surfaces that are unsealed are much like a sponge and will absorb oil, food, or beverage spills, resulting in permanent staining. Proper sealing can protect your flooring from permanent damage by creating an invisible barrier over the tile and grout.
